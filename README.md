# Exercise checklist

Please read the following guidelines very carefully and check all your exercises
to make sure you comply to all of them.

## No name in `README.md` file

Please make sure to fill in your name at the marked space at the top of the document.

## Make sure you ONLY give valid SQL answers

The `MariaDB [database_name]>` and `-->` are parts of the mysql client, but are
NOT valid SQL code. Please remove these marks, as the results cannot be executed
and verified by running them again.

## Markdown markup ignored

**Check ALL documents for markup errors**. View all your documents on GitHub to
verify the markup is correctly. In vscode you can use the markdown preview to
inspect the markdown result (press `F1` -> `Markdown: Open preview at the side`).

If markdown is unreadable, **the document will not be reviewed**.
